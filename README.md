# Student Management System

## Overview

This C++ program is designed to manage and analyze student data. It allows users to input information about students, such as their name, age, group, and marks in three subjects (RPM, Test, and Math). The program provides various functionalities to filter, analyze, and display the data based on specific criteria.

## Features

1. **Input Data**: Users can input data for multiple students, including their name, age, group, and marks in three subjects.
2. **Output Data**: Displays all entered student data in a tabular format.
3. **Find by Group**: Filters and displays students belonging to a specific group.
4. **Find by Age**: Filters and displays students based on their age (either older or younger than a specified value).
5. **Find by Marks**: Displays students who scored above a certain threshold in any of the three subjects.
6. **Find High Achievers**: Identifies students with high average scores in individual subjects or across all subjects.
7. **Find Specific Conditions**: Finds students who meet specific conditions, such as having a high score in one subject but a low score in another.

## File Structure

- **func.h**: Header file containing function declarations.
- **func.cpp**: Implementation of the functions declared in `func.h`.
- **string-functions.cpp**: Main program file where the execution begins.
